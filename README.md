# audioreconstruction

This project delves into the exploration of audio signal reconstruction using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and analyzes the effects of compression on audio data. The primary objectives include loading and understanding the provided audio signal matrix, FPP_DATA.mat, playing it, and then applying DCT. We then reconstruct the signal fromcoefficients, and evaluate the impact of compression. The project also involves implementing a filtering mechanism based on several thresholds and assessing the quality of compressed signals.

The results are useful in providing insights into the trade-offs between compression levels and audio quality. This project hopes to teach basic methodologies in audio signal processing, compression techniques, and the evaluation of reconstructed signals.
